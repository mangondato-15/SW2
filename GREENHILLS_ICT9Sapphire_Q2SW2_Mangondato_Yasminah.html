		<td>Maltipoo</td>
		<td>The Maltipoo is a winning combination of a Maltese and poodle. Gentle, playful, and highly intelligent, this hybrid inherits every positive quality from each parent breed, making them a smart, active and affectionate crossbreed. Maltipoos are patient, kind companions for everyone young and old. They'll fit right into almost any home, whether it's a busy family circus or a table for one. A Maltipoo won't get bigger than 20 pounds. It's because of this adorable disposition and a nearly "hypoallergenic" coat that Maltipoos are growing in popularity. Easy to train and easy to love, Maltipoos are a great choice for a first-time dog owner or animal lover.</td>
